A language game for groups, designed to help learners start speaking (and having fun with) their language.

This is conceptually a card game, loosely based on such party classics as Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples, where
the object is to tell the most entertaining story in the target language based on three images selected by the player whose 
turn it is. (Or set of words, or sentence, depending on level of language familiarity.) The selecting player determines who 
wins each hand. 

For this web app, I am striving to create a language-neutral default UI using icons so that play can proceed without recourse 
to languages other than the target language. The design is language-neutral so that it can be used with any target language,
and I hope that it will be particularly useful in efforts to revitalize heritage languages. 

The initial app will simply provide randomized hands and the ability to select 3 and discard the rest. Planned future features 
include:
    + Scorekeeping for 3-15 players.
    + User accounts allowing for the creation of custom captions, decks, and cards.
    + Example captions in my own heritage language, Irish or Gaeilge.
    + Flashcard-style display of captions.
    
Thanks for your interest, and please feel free to contact me if you have any comments or suggestions.
